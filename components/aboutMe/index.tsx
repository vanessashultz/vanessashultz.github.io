          I am a software engineer with a passion for creating and building{" "}
          <span className="text-tertiary font-bold">clean</span> and{" "}

          I started in speech pathology where I was introduced to the
          transformative impact of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)
          devices, which enabled individuals with communication challenges to
          express themselves. Motivated by this experience, I transitioned to
          software engineering, where I could make a broader difference while
          leveraging my problem-solving skills. By combining my passion for
          helping others, ability to quickly research and learn, and desire to
          innovate, I found a path to create meaningful and lasting impact in
          the lives of many.

          In my free time, I enjoy playing videos games, such as the{" "}

          and <span className="text-tertiary font-bold">It Takes Two</span>. I
          have recently rediscovered my love for reading sci-fi books and am
          currently emersed into{" "}
          <span className="text-tertiary font-bold">The Expanse Series</span>.
          Crafting and DIY projects take up a large part of my time. My crafts
          include crocheting, drawing, restoring antique furniture and my
          proudest achievement:{" "}

          one of my three cats üêà‚Äç‚¨õ and two dogs üêï‚Äçü¶∫. My two standard poodles,
          Violet and Lola, love joining me on daily walks around the city. My
          favorite place in the world is{" "}

            12,000 feet above sea level

          on a mountain (after the altitude sickness wears off of course). I
          dream to one day own a mountain where I can hike and play my
          piano/sing as loud as I want!
