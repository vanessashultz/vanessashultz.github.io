          I started in speech pathology where I was introduced to the transformative impact of Augmentative and
          Alternative Communication (AAC) devices, which enabled individuals with communication challenges to express
          themselves. Motivated by this experience, I transitioned to software engineering, where I could make a broader
          difference while leveraging my problem-solving skills. By combining my passion for helping others, ability to
          quickly research and learn, and desire to innovate, I found a path to create meaningful and lasting impact in
          the lives of many.
